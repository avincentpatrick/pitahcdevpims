# Active Context

## Current Focus

The primary focus is on fixing a critical bug in the "Issuances" module where document uploads were failing. The investigation revealed that the `documents` table was missing a `document_date` column, and the controller was attempting to save to a non-existent field.

## Recent Changes

- **Database Schema Update:** A new migration was created and executed to add the `document_date` column to the `documents` table.
- **Controller Logic Correction:** The `IssuanceController` was updated to save the `document_date` from the form into the new corresponding database column. The incorrect logic that attempted to save this value to the `created_at` timestamp has been removed.
- **Abandoned Feature Removal:** All code and documentation related to the Tesseract OCR functionality, which was an abandoned concept, has been removed from the controller and the memory bank to simplify the codebase and prevent future confusion.

## Next Steps

- Continue with the UI/UX enhancements for the Issuances module as outlined in `issuances-module-enhancements.md`.
- Address the known technical debt issues listed in `progress.md`.
