# Progress

## What Works

The "Issuances" module is now a fully functional and well-documented component of the application. The key working features include:

- **Core Infrastructure:** The basic Laravel application is stable, with all migrations and dependencies correctly installed.
- **Server-Side Data Table:** The module features a robust, server-side powered DataTable that can efficiently handle large volumes of documents.
- **Advanced UI/UX:** The user interface has been enhanced with a collapsible filter panel and a fixed ("sticky") table header for improved usability.
- **Bug Fixes:** Corrected a critical bug that prevented document uploads by adding a `document_date` column to the database and fixing the controller logic.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** A detailed, step-by-step build log for the Issuances module is now available in `issuances-module-build-log.md`, providing a complete history of its development.

## What's Left to Build

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** A robust system for managing user access.
- **Personnel Information Module:** Forms and views for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.
- **Document Management Module:** Functionality for uploading, tracking, and managing documents beyond the basic list view.
- **Reporting Module:** Generation of reports based on personnel data.
- **Dashboard:** A central dashboard to provide an overview of key information.
- **Frontend Design:** The overall user interface, layout, and styling of the application needs to be refined.

## Known Issues

- The `yajra/laravel-datatables-buttons` package was installed, which also pulled in `yajra/laravel-datatables-oracle`. This is not ideal, as the project does not use Oracle. This should be reviewed and corrected in the future.
- The abandoned `fruitcake/laravel-cors` package is still in use. This should be replaced with the official Laravel CORS middleware.
- The `laravelcollective/html` package is abandoned and should be replaced with `spatie/laravel-html`.
- The `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` package is abandoned and should be replaced with `symfony/mailer`.
